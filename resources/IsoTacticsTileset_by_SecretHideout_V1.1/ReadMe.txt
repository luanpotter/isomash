Hello and thank you so much for purchasing this asset.
Your kindness will help me to continue creating pixel art which is something I truly love doing. <3

Unity Users

Select the sprite sheet in the project. 

In the inspector...

- Set Sprite Mode to Multiple 
- Set Pixels Per Unit to 32
- Use Sprite Editor to slice the spritesheet into a 32x32 grid
- Set Filter Mode to Point (no filter)
- Set Max Size to 256
- Set Format to RGBA 32bit

If you have any issues, suggestions or feedback then please leave a comment at the below link.
